# The Sustainability Scale

The number one reason why people may not choose to live sustainably is because they think it is more expensive. Often, products marked as “sustainable” or “eco-friendly” are marked at a higher price than some less sustainable items. Our app, the *Sustainability Scale*, is looking to change this perception.

Living a sustainable lifestyle does not necessarily mean it’ll be more expensive. While purchasing an eco-friendly toothbrush may cost a few dollars more than the typical plastic one, there are many ways you can “earn back” those extra bucks, and the *Sustainability Scale* helps you do that. By completing daily tasks such as walking a mile to save gas money, or drinking tap water instead of bottled water, you can save money in your everyday life while making sustainable choices.

Additionally, the *Sustainability Scale* helps you keep track of how much money you’ve spent extra from purchasing sustainable items and how much you’ve saved from completing various tasks. This information is displayed in a chart and represented by the scale visual, making it easier to see where you are in your money-saving journey.
